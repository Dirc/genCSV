# List all files in a csv file

## Use-case

We have a directory where we put all my receipts from the renovation of our house.
We want to have an overview of each file and it's value.

fileToCSV is a tool which creates or updates a csv file which:

- contains a list of all files in the directory
  - (we can manually add the values to the list)
- count the total of all known values

## Usage

```shell
./csvGen --dir "./example" --csv "files.csv"

./csvGen --help
```

## ToDo

- [x] unit tests
- [ ] loglevel
- [x] CLI
- [ ] remove files?
